				<p>Other information</p>
				<p>Lots of things. Lots of words. Many many words, just shittons of words. Yeah, this is where lots of words go.</p>

				<p>In the middle of Barbados there are 2 parishes St. Thomas and St. George, and even though these are the only two parishes in Barbados that are not on the coast, there are still some suitable inland Barbados accommodation available.</p>

				<p>There are plenty of tourist attractions in these two parishes therefore by choosing to stay in the middle of the island, you are centrally located to tour around not only this area but also you can easily access the south, west and east coasts of the island.</p>

				<p>Neither St. George or St. Thomas has any hotel complexes, however in both parishes you will find self-catering options with luxury villas available in St. Thomas, which offer high-end accommodation with staff on hand to cater to you. These villas usually come with a private swimming pool, gardener, maid and chef.</p>

				<p>When deciding on your accommodation, you need to decide what you are looking for from your vacation; perhaps you are interested in horse riding, if so then this part of the island is ideal for hours of trekking through cane fields, woods and gullies.</p>

				<p>You will also find excellent polo grounds on the inland of Barbados; so staying here is a good choice if you are interested in this sport.</p>
